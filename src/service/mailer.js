  <p>We hope this email finds you well. We wanted to inform you about recent activity on your account. We have detected a login to your account from a new device or location. As part of our security measures, we want to keep you informed and ensure that you are aware of any access to your account.

  <strong>Here are a few steps you can take to ensure the security of your account:</strong>
